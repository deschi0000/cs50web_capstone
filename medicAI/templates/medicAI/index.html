            I wanted to create something that could both demonstrate the skills I've learned throughout this course and
            have potential real-world benefits.
            Since there is a strain on the Canadian health care system, resulting in overworked medical workers, the
            idea to make an AI-aid for diagnosing patients, would help streamline the work for doctors and nurses, and
            also reduce the potential of misdiagnoses.

            </br><b>Contained in each file:</b>

            </br><b>views.py</b> - The controller logic for rendering the different pages of the progam to the user in the view.

            </br><b>helpers.py</b> - Helper functions dedicated to parsing the Json return objects used with the Gemini integration.

            </br><b>script.js</b> - Using JS to get cookies/CSRF tokens, show notifications and impleement some Jquery to UI design
                (specifically adding and removing tests from the AI-diagnosis section).

            </br><b>styles.css</b> - While bootstrap takes care of most of the look, this file focuses mainly on mobile
            responsiveness.

            <b>Distinctiveness:</b></br></br>

            This project is distintive in that it serves as a tool to aid ER medical staff in making decisions based on
            their patients. This project utilizes bootstrap and the fontawesome libraries to help make the site more
            user-friendly and mobile responsive, a departure of the mostly css projects throughout the course. The
            distinctive feature implementd in this project is the Gemini API, which uses their AI to assist the medical
            user in making and/or prioritizing tests of the patients in the system.
        </p>    
        <p class="lead">
            <b>Complexity:</b></br></br>

            Finding a way to consistenly query and parse data brought back through the Gemini API required specialized
            helper functions to get the job done. The schemas for the database (in this case patients, medical tests,
            hospital visits, etc.) provided their own challenge in understanding the levels of normalization required to
            consistenly store and retrieve data, requiring the reworking of my databasee a few times.
